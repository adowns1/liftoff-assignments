## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a DBT (dialectic behavioral therapy) diary app that will allow clients and therapists to track emotions/feelings/urges. It will allow clients to log in, and to create data points for emotions/feelings/urges and view graphs to assess trends.
This project was motivated by the need of a therapist to access journal cards that get lost or destroyed when on paper, graphs data for easy recognition of trends.
